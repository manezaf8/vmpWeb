          <h1>Meet Maneza F8</h1>
          <img src="images/manezaf8_2.jpg" alt="Mr VMP" width="260" />
          <P>PERSONAL: Maneza was Given life by his mother Nothini Mabetshe and his father 
          	Mkhanyiseli Ntshoza in the late 80s, He was born and raised in Khayelitsha till He
          	 was about 6 years when Him and His family started to move around in Khayelitsha from 
          	 Site-B, C-section, M-section till they end up in Philippi. From Philippi He also went to 
          	 stay at Eastern Cape for few years at about the age of 8, then went back to Philippi, Cape town.
 </p>
 
<P>STREET-LIFE: While moving up and 
	down in the streets of Cape town it was not easy for Him. Life in the 
	townships is all about survival, To survive in the streets you have to learn 
	the hard way to be strong and bold even if you think u were born weak and soft. 
	His skills for soccer kinda made life a lot better for him because drawing up in the
	 streets soccer was always the way to get out of the bad habits and negative things that associated 
	 with the black youth such as (Drugs, alcohol at young age, gangs etc...). Through that moving up and down He had to
	  keep on changing schools adjusting to new people all the time, and that is not easy. He made friends. Through that 
	  but He also made enemies because living in the Hood compels you to have some friends and enemies what we refer to them 
	  as Ghosts in the streets.  Through all that He was adored by older brothers in the neighborhood who were 
	  very much into Hip-Hop, So His life was always surrounded by Rap muzik in the days of Tupac, Snoop dog, LL 
	  cool j, Eminem, D12, Dr Dre, Method man and Red Man etc.. I am talking 90s where Rap was all about real life tackling real
	   issues. That is what inspired Maneza F8 and pushed Him into the muzik direction. </p>

<P> MANEZA F8: Maneza maybe you ask yourself what is the word stands for anyway. 
	Well let me brief y'all about this name, Maneza is the combination of His two last-names 
	His mother and father's: Mabetshe and Ntshoza
Ma(Mabetshe) N(Ntsoza) E(Etshe) Za(Ntshoza).

Interesting heey Lol yeah it is, Okay now F8 because in South Africa or World wide
 we were given identity numbers His ID number got more than five Eights which is rare 
 in the South african identities that is where the F8 is coming from again interesting right? 
 Lol of cause it is.
That is where Maneza F8 comes from. </p>
